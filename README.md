# ParseRBE

Pretty early stages of a program to read & write Diabotical map files.

Most of the original reverse-engineering was done by Armaku (Discord), this script written by me (twitch.tv/PressOK)
Any future contributions by anyone should be accordingly credited, too, probably.

# Notes

- There's a short todo list within the file that should be completed soon if you want to check back for a more functional library
- Have confirmed with FireFrog (original DBT dev) that the map file format will change in the future - will remain backwards compatible
- Will probably be ported to C# in the near future, and Febreeze (twitch.tv/yesitsfebreeze) will likely be porting to JS

# License

See the included GPL3.0 license, the main reason being that this is a "community tool/project" and staying open source is ideal
